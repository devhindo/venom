what's a key-value store?
- it's a kind of nonrelational database that stores data as a collection of key-value pairs. they're different from the better-known relational databases, like Miscrosoft SQL Server or PostgresSQL. Where relational databases structure their data among fixed tables with well-defined data types, key-value stores are far simpler, allowing users to associate a unique identifier (the key) with an arbitrary value. 

Features:
- Venom is designed to be idempotent by default, allowing you to perfrom the same operation multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application.

Future Plans:

- use GraphQL to allow clients to query the server for specific data.
- implement remote procedure calls (RPCs) to allow clients to execute functions on the server.
